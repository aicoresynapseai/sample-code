# This GitHub Actions workflow is an example of what a Generative AI
# might produce for a Java Spring Boot application's CI/CD pipeline.
# It includes common stages for building, testing, security, containerization, and deployment.

name: Java CI/CD Pipeline (GenAI Generated)

# GenAI defines triggers based on common development practices:
# - on push to main/master for continuous integration
# - on pull request for code review and early validation
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
