Welcome to GenAIRelaseNotesGenerator!

This project demonstrates how Generative AI (GenAI) can be integrated into a Java CI/CD pipeline to automatically generate release notes. It simulates fetching Git commit messages and deployment logs, then uses a placeholder GenAI API call to synthesize this information into a human-readable release note document.

**Project Overview:**
In a modern CI/CD pipeline, continuous integration and delivery automate many stages of software development. However, the creation of release notes often remains a manual, time-consuming bottleneck. This project showcases an approach to automate this crucial documentation step using AI.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Git Service:** Simulates retrieving commit messages from a specified release range. In a real scenario, this would interact with a Git repository using JGit or by executing Git commands.
2.  **Deployment Log Service:** Simulates fetching relevant deployment logs. In a real CI/CD setup, this would connect to a CI/CD platform (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) via its API, or a log aggregation service (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack).
3.  **GenAI Service:** This is the heart of the automation. It takes the collected commit messages and deployment logs, crafts a prompt, and sends it to a GenAI API (e.g., OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini). The AI then processes this data and returns structured release notes. For this demo, the actual API interaction is mocked, but the prompt engineering concept is illustrated.
4.  **Release Notes Generator Application:** The main application orchestrates the flow, collecting data, calling the GenAI service, and presenting the generated notes.

**How it fits into CI/CD:**
This Java application would typically be executed as a post-deployment step in your CI/CD pipeline. After a successful build and deployment, the pipeline would:
1.  Trigger this application.
2.  The application fetches recent commits (since the last release) and relevant deployment logs for the current build/deployment.
3.  It then sends this aggregated data to the GenAI API.
4.  The AI generates the release notes.
5.  The notes can then be automatically published to a wiki, emailed to stakeholders, or pushed to a documentation platform.

**Setup and Run:**

**Prerequisites:**
*   Java 17 or higher
*   Maven 3.6 or higher

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd GenAIRelaseNotesGenerator

2.  **Build the project:**
    mvn clean install

3.  **Run the application:**
    java -jar target/gen-ai-release-notes-generator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

**Simulated Data:**
For demonstration purposes, this project uses `simulated_commits.txt` and `simulated_deployment_log.txt` files to represent the data that would typically come from a Git repository and a CI/CD system's logs, respectively. You can modify these files to see how the AI prompt would change based on different inputs.

**GenAI API Integration (Conceptual):**
The `GenAIService` includes a placeholder `callGenAIApi` method. In a real application, you would replace this with actual API client calls to your chosen GenAI provider (e.g., using `OkHttpClient` or `RestTemplate` with `spring-webflux` to make HTTP requests to the GenAI endpoint). Remember to secure your API keys and handle rate limits.

**Future Enhancements:**
*   Actual Git integration using JGit library.
*   Integration with real CI/CD platform APIs (Jenkins, GitLab, GitHub Actions).
*   Configurable prompt templates for different release note styles (e.g., user-facing, technical, internal).
*   Integration with issue trackers (Jira, GitHub Issues) to enrich context.
*   Saving generated notes to a file, database, or publishing to a wiki.
*   Error handling and retry mechanisms for GenAI API calls.

This project serves as a starting point to envision how intelligent automation can streamline your software delivery process!
