    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '17' # Specify the JDK version for your Java project
        distribution: 'temurin' # Use Temurin OpenJDK distribution
        cache: maven # Cache Maven dependencies for faster builds

    - name: Build with Maven and Run AI-Simulated Tests
      run: mvn -B clean install # Runs the Maven build command.
                                # The 'install' phase includes 'test', so all JUnit tests (including our AI-simulated ones) will run.
                                # -B is for batch mode, non-interactive.
      # This step showcases how AI-generated tests are seamlessly integrated into your CI pipeline.
      # Their comprehensive nature ensures robust validation with every code push.

    - name: Analyze Test Results (Optional, for reporting)
      # In a real CI/CD, you might integrate tools here to analyze test reports
      # generated by Surefire (e.g., target/surefire-reports/*.xml)
      # and publish them to a dashboard or code quality tool.
      # For example, using actions like:
      # - uses: EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action@v2
      #   with:
      #     files: target/surefire-reports/*.xml
      run: echo "Test results generated in target/surefire-reports"

    # Additional CI/CD steps could include:
    # - Static Code Analysis (e.g., SonarQube scan)
    # - Security Scanning (SAST/DAST tools)
    # - Building Docker Images (if applicable for microservices)
    # - Pushing artifacts to a repository (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory, Docker Registry)
    # These steps could also be generated or optimized by GenAI as described in the video.
