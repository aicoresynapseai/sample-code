name: Java CI with AI-Enhanced Testing

# This GitHub Actions workflow defines a CI/CD pipeline for the GenAITestingForJava project.
# It demonstrates where AI-driven testing would fit into an automated build process,
# ensuring that even AI-generated tests are run automatically.

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ] # Trigger the workflow on pushes to the 'main' branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ] # Trigger on pull requests targeting the 'main' branch

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use the latest Ubuntu runner provided by GitHub Actions

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository # Step 1: Get the source code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up JDK 17 # Step 2: Configure the Java Development Kit environment
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '17' # Specify Java 17, consistent with pom.xml
        distribution: 'temurin' # Use Temurin distribution (OpenJ9 or HotSpot compatible)
        cache: maven # Cache Maven dependencies for faster builds

    # Conceptual Step: AI Test Generation (simulated)
    # In a real scenario, an AI testing tool (e.g., Diffblue Cover) would run here.
    # It would analyze the 'src/main' code and generate JUnit tests into 'src/test'.
    # This step is commented out as it requires the actual tool's setup.
    # - name: Generate AI-driven Tests (Conceptual)
    #   run: |
    #     echo "Simulating AI test generation process..."
    #     # Example command for Diffblue Cover CLI (requires installation)
    #     # dcover create --src main/java --test-output src/test/java
    #     # Example for Maven plugin (if configured in pom.xml)
    #     # mvn com.diffblue.cover:cover-maven-plugin:generate
    #   # The output of this step would be new or updated files in src/test/java
    #   # which are then picked up by the 'Run Maven tests' step.

    - name: Build with Maven and Run Tests # Step 3: Compile the project and execute all JUnit tests
      run: mvn clean install # 'install' phase includes 'test' phase, running all tests
      # This step will run the manually written tests (CalculatorServiceTest.java)
      # and would also run any tests generated by an AI tool if the conceptual step above
      # were fully implemented and generated tests.

    # Optional: Package application (if it were a deployable Spring Boot JAR)
    # - name: Package Spring Boot application
    #   run: mvn package -DskipTests # Skip tests here if they were already run in 'install'
    #   # This would produce the target/*.jar file
