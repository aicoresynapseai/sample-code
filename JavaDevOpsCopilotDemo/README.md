This repository serves as a practical demonstration for the "Using GitHub Copilot for Java DevOps Automation" tutorial. It showcases various files and configurations where GitHub Copilot can provide significant assistance, streamlining typical Java DevOps tasks.

The project includes examples for:
1.  **Maven Build Automation (pom.xml)**: Adding dependencies, configuring plugins.
2.  **Java Test Automation (UserServiceTest.java)**: Generating unit tests with JUnit 5 and Mockito.
3.  **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform - main.tf)**: Defining cloud resources like AWS S3 buckets and EC2 instances.
4.  **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (GitHub Actions - maven.yml)**: Setting up build, test, and deployment stages.
5.  **Granular Deployment Scripts (Bash - deploy_java_app.sh, Python - deploy_java_app.py)**: Automating application deployment and service management.

**How to Use This Demo with GitHub Copilot:**

To best experience how Copilot helps, open these files in your IDE (VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA with Copilot extension installed and active). As you start typing comments or partial code, observe Copilot's suggestions.

**Examples of Copilot's Assistance Illustrated in This Project:**

*   **In `pom.xml`**:
    *   Start typing `<!-- Add Spring Boot starter web dependency -->` and observe Copilot suggesting the `<dependency>` block.
    *   Type `<!-- Configure maven compiler plugin for Java 17 -->` and see it suggest the `<plugin>` configuration.
*   **In `UserServiceTest.java`**:
    *   Add a comment `// Test successful user registration` above an empty method and watch Copilot scaffold a JUnit test.
    *   Type `// Mock the UserRepository` and see Mockito setup suggestions.
*   **In `terraform/main.tf`**:
    *   Start a new line with `# Create an AWS S3 bucket for application logs` and Copilot will suggest the `resource "aws_s3_bucket"` block.
    *   Type `# Define an AWS EC2 instance for our Java application` and it will suggest EC2 resource configuration.
*   **In `.github/workflows/maven.yml`**:
    *   Start a new workflow and type `# Name of the workflow` then `# Trigger on push to main branch` and Copilot will help with the YAML syntax for `name:` and `on:`.
    *   Type `# Job to build and test our Java application` then `# Steps to checkout code, setup JDK, and run Maven build` and watch Copilot suggest the `jobs:`, `steps:`, `uses: actions/checkout@v3`, `uses: actions/setup-java@v3`, and `run: mvn package` blocks.
*   **In `scripts/deploy_java_app.sh`**:
    *   Add a comment `# Bash script to stop Java service, pull artifact, and restart` and Copilot will suggest `systemctl stop`, `wget`, `java -jar`, and `systemctl start` commands.
    *   Type `# Add error handling` and it might suggest `set -e` or `if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then ...`.
*   **In `scripts/deploy_java_app.py`**:
    *   Type `# Python script to deploy Java application and manage configuration` and Copilot can suggest functions for reading JSON/YAML config, making HTTP requests, or restarting services using `subprocess`.

This project is designed to be a starting point, encouraging you to experiment with GitHub Copilot and discover its full potential in your daily Java DevOps tasks.
